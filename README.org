* Galaster - A 3D Dynamic Graph Visualizer


** Overview

   Galaster is a system for visualizing dynamic graphs, the goal of this project is
   to create an opensource version of ubigraph. Currently it is not usable and still
   needs lots of development efforts, you can compile this half-way done prototype
   and preview the dynamic graphs in action. Works to be done is listed below so if
   you are interested in this project please stay tuned or make contributions through
   pull requests.

** How To Build

   You need GLFW, FreeType and CMake to build this project
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
   #+END_SRC

** Galaster In Action

** Future Works

   - RPC based API and bindings for various programming languages
   - +Spline edges and arrows+
   - +Fast repulsion force calculation algorithm+
   - +Rendering text labels+
   - +Smarter auto camera+
   - +Proper rendering options to make edges look consistent in various view angles+
