* Galaster - A 3D Dynamic Graph Visualizer


** Overview

   Galaster is a system for visualizing dynamic graphs. Currently it is not usable
   and still needs lots of development efforts, you can compile this half-way done
   prototype and preview the dynamic graphs in action. Works to be done is listed
   below so if you are interested in this project please stay tuned or make
   contributions through pull requests.

** Future Works

   - RPC based API and bindings for various programming languages
   - +Spline edges and arrows+
   - +Fast repulsion force calculation algorithm+
   - Rendering text labels
   - +Smarter auto camera+
   - +Proper rendering options to make edges look consistent in various view angles+
